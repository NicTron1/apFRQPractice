      "question": "Describe one characteristic of a membrane that requires a channel be present for chloride ions to passively cross the membrane",
      "simplifiedChoices": [
        "What is the purpose of a chloride ion channel in membrane transport?",
        "What makes a channel necessary for passive transport across a membrane?",
        "How does a chloride ion channel aid in the passive transport of chloride ions across a membrane?",
        "What role does a chloride ion channel play in the active transport of chloride ions across a membrane?"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This question is asking why a chloride ion channel is needed for the passive transport of chloride ions across a membrane. The student should know that a chloride ion channel is a necessary component for passive transport and be familiar with the basic concept of membrane transport."

      "question": "Crossing over creates physical connections that are required for proper separation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis. A diploid cell with four pairs of homologous chromosomes undergoes meiosis to produce four haploid cells. Crossing over occurs between only three of the pairs. Predict the number of chromosomes most likely present in each of the four haploid cells. ",
      "simplifiedChoices": [
        "How does crossing over affect the number of homologous chromosomes in a diploid cell during meiosis?",
        "What is the significance of homologous chromosomes in creating physical connections during meiosis?",
        "How many chromosomes are in each of the four resulting haploid cells?",
        "What happens to the number of chromosomes during crossing over in a diploid cell?"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "This question is asking the student to predict the number of chromosomes in the haploid cells resulting from the meiosis of a diploid cell that has undergone crossing over between only three pairs of homologous chromosomes. The student is expected to know the relationship between crossing over and the proper separation of homologous chromosomes in meiosis, and how this affects the number of chromosomes in the resulting haploid cells."

      "question": "Explain how human activities that add toxins to the soil could change a community with many species at each trophic level into a community with few species at each trophic level.",
      "simplifiedChoices": [
        "How do soil toxins impact a species?",
        "What does a primary prodcer do for the rest of the ecosystem it lives in?",
        "Where do primary producers get their energy?",
        "How would the removal of a primary producer reduce the number of species in each trophic level of a community?"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "This question is asking the student to explain how the introduction of toxins to soil through human activities can kill off plants, or primary producers, and how this can have an impact across the food web of a community."

      "question": "Introduction of mRNAs into cells allows the cells to produce foreign proteins that they 1 point might not normally produce. Explain why the production of a foreign protein may be more likely from the introduction of mRNA than DNA into cells.",
      "simplifiedChoices": [
        "Why is the introduction of mRNA more efficient than DNA for producing proteins in cells?",
        "How does the introduction of mRNA and DNA affect cell division in cells?",
        "Why is the introduction of mRNA and DNA necessary for the production of endogenous proteins in cells?",
        "How does the introduction of DNA into cells interfere with the production of foreign proteins?"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "This question is asking the student to explain why introducing mRNA is a more efficient way to produce foreign proteins in cells than DNA. The student is expected to understand the steps involved in protein synthesis and how mRNA allows direct translation of a foreign protein, while DNA requires transcription and post-transcriptional processing. The focus is on the differences in efficiency between mRNA and DNA in introducing foreign proteins and not just their general roles in protein synthesis."
